# The nominative: Who? What?

When bound, the nominative denotes the subject of the verb: who or what is doing the action. Every verb has a bound nominative. There is one exception to this: when that nominative would be the equivalent of "I", "you", etc. In those cases, the pronoun is excluded and implicit in the verb. In that case, plurality is derived from the context.

> Example
>
> In the English sentence "**The warriors** live", `the warriors` is the subject. In Saia, this is written as =[fiairi **ioàn**]=. Here, =[ioàn]= is a Body Plural Nominative conjugation of =[oàn]=.

> Example
>
> The sentence "**The forests** burned" is written as =[eiobaòroa **òmedei**]=. If it were only a singular forest that burned, it would simply be the empty conjugated =[eiobaòroa **medei**]=.

Unbound nominatives are rare, but may be used as a vocative - when you call out to someone in a sentence without verbs.

> Example
>
> If you Saroah walking by and want her attention you could just call out =[saroà]=, in the nominative.

When you want to list multiple subjects, you will have to use conjunctions. If such a list results in plural subjects, the verb should also be in plural form.

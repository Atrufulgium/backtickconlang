Copular sentences are a special type of sentence that describes properties of the subject. In English, the copula is the verb `to be`. In Saia, it is a verb conjugated according to the following table.

&nbsp; | **Past** _(Casual)_ | **Past** _(Polite)_ | **Present** _(Casual)_ | **Present** _(Polite)_ | **Future** _(Casual)_ | **Future** _(Polite)_
--------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------
**1st incl.** | =[ò]=    | =[òboa]= |          | =[iboa]= | `n/a`   | `n/a`
**1st excl.** | =[òshi]= | `n/a`    | =[ishi]= | `n/a`    | `n/a`   | `n/a`
**2nd**       | =[òa]=   | =[òmoa]= | =[i]=    | =[imoa]= | =[a]=   | `n/a`
**3rd**       | =[òri]=  | =[òroa]= | =[iri]=  | =[iroa]= | =[ari]= | =[aroa]=

The three listed tenses are self-explanatory: the Past form is used for events in the past, and the Future form is used for events in the future. Note that some cells are listed as `n/a`. These conjugations simply don't exist for cultural reasons. In particular, talking about your own future in a direct manner as if you can affect it is a very conceited viewpoint, so it simply fell out of fashion and then impossible to be direct about your own future.

There is no plural embedded in the verb; this can be derived from the subject's plurality. The person _is_ embedded, however. The 1st person form `I`/`We` is split up in an inclusive and exclusive variant. For singular, this is irrelevant, and you always take the inclusive variant. For plural, there is a difference: it denotes whether the `We` that is discussed is inclusive, or exclusive the listener. "_We won the lottery!_" has quite a different meaning depending on which it is! The second person `You` and third person `He`/`She`/`It`/`They` function as normal.

Another thing one might note is that there are two levels of politeness in the table above. The casual form is one you would use when conversing with a group of peers, or other people you know would not feel disrespected when talked to casually. The polite form is used for everyone else - gods, teachers, unknown people you encounter on the street. Using the casual form when the polite form is required is quite derogatory. It is impolite to talk about something relating to you, but not to the listener, so the exclusive first person does not have a polite version; hence those `n/a` cells.

You use the copula by simply putting it at the start of the sentence, and then putting two nouns (in [Nominative case](/grammar/noun-cases)) anywhere after. The copula simply says that the first such noun is also described by the second noun.

> Note that the copula requires two _nouns_. Compare this to English where you may also put in other word types: "The sky is blue" has an adjective `blue`. To turn this into a noun, see the section (much later) on [nominalisation](/grammar/nominalisation).

> Example
> 
> =[**iri** zhaa àzajhòn]= means "The god **is** a judge". Note again the lack of articles in Saia. Depending on the context. this could also mean "The god is the judge", "A god is the judge", or "A god is a judge".

> Example
> 
> =[**òroa** eioba medei]= means "The fire **was** a forest", where =[oroa]= is the past copula. Poor forest, going up in flames like this. The person is probably speaking to a superior, as the copula is written in polite form.

> Example
> 
> =[**aroa** fia maole]= means "Life **will be** death".

Of course, you can also say things not in third person. Note that the pronouns `I`/`You`/`He`/`She`/etc. are not written down. If you are missing a noun, they are the implicit subject. This implicit subject can be both singular and plural. Which of these it is can be recognised as the other noun will also be plural in that case.

> Example
>
> =[àzajhòn]= has the first person inclusive casual copula, which is an empty word. The `I` is then implicit. As a result, this means "I **am** a judge".

> Example
> 
> =[**a** zhaa]= means "You**'ll be** a god", casually. For an example with an explicit second-person subject, one could say =[**a** àzajhòn zhaa]=. This would mean something like "Judge-you **will be** a god".

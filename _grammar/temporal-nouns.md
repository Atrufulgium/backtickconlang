Verb conjugation is not limited to just verbs. Any noun, not just the verb of the sentence, can be conjugated to give temporal information. It simply says that the noun is in the past/present/future, that the noun relates in what way to the speaker/listener, and the formality. (It also allows for a mechanism denoting perfect and imperfect tense, and in general has quite some interplay with tenses; see the section on verbs.) For convenience, we list the same conjugations again.

&nbsp; | **Past** _(Casual)_ | **Past** _(Polite)_ | **Present** _(Casual)_ | **Present** _(Polite)_ | **Future** _(Casual)_ | **Future** _(Polite)_
--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|------------
**1st incl.** | =[-ò-]=    | =[-òboa-]= |            | =[-iboa-]= | `n/a`     | `n/a`
**1st excl.** | =[-òshi-]= | `n/a`      | =[-ishi-]= | `n/a`      | `n/a`     | `n/a`
**2nd**       | =[-òa-]=   | =[-òmoa-]= | =[-i-]=    | =[-imoa-]= | =[-a-]=   | `n/a`
**3rd**       | =[-òri-]=  | =[-òroa-]= | =[-iri-]=  | =[-iroa-]= | =[-ari-]= | =[-aroa-]=

In English, this suffix will usually be translated as a small separate clause modifying the noun.

> Example
> 
> If you are talking about someone who in the future will become a warrior, you may address them by =[oànaroa]=, with the =[-aroa-]= Future Polite 3rd suffix. One may translate this fragment into an English sentence as "he, **who will become a warrior**," in a formal way.
> 
> If, instead, you are talking directly to a retired warrior, you could address them by =[oànòmoa]=. In English, this means "you, **who was once a warrior**,", which is also formal.

Turning a noun into a temporal noun is often not required. As such, a noun not having a suffix will more often than not simply mean nothing, instead of being a Present Casual 1st Inclusive. The only case in which a suffix is required, are verbs.

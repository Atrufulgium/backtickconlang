Nouns have cases. As verbs are nouns, verbs also have cases. Verbs then inherit their plurality from their case, which must match the noun's plurality. But more importantly, the case of the verb affects the sentence's voice. The verb voice affects who carry out the action, or are affected, etc.

> Example
>
> In English, "I did it", and "It was done by me" are two different sentences expressing the same thing in a different voice. In the first sentence, the _active_ voice has `I` as subject, and `it` as object. The second sentence, in the passive voice, has `It` as subject instead.

As Saia has seven cases, it also has seven primary verb voices. They are summarised in the below table using =[oàn]= as the verb of a full sentence.

**Case** | **Voice**  | **Saia**      | **English**
---------|------------|---------------|:------------
Nom      | Active     | =[oàn]=       | I'm fighting
Acc      | Passive    | =[meoàn]=     | I'm being fought _(by someone (Caus))_
Dat      | Reciprocal | =[meooàn]=    | I'm fighting myself
Gen      | Optative   | =[ooàn]=      | May I fight; I hope I fight
Loc      | Adjutative | =[qheoàn]=    | I'm helping _(someone (Caus))_ with fighting
Inst     | Imperative | =[qheioeoàn]= | Fight, self!; I must fight
Caus     | Causative  | =[eioeoàn]=   | I make _(someone (Inst))_ fight

Three of the voices (passive, adjutative, and causative) have an optional additional bound case, describing in more detail what happens. This bound case takes precedence over any bound case of the same type a verb may have. In other words, it appears sooner after the verb than other bound cases of the same case. Examples of this phenomenon can be found below.

## The nominative: active voice
This is the voice that has been used in all examples so far. It is the "default" voice, at least as much as it is in English. For examples, simply browse everything we have done so far.

## The accusative: passive voice
In this voice, the nominative is not the one who does the action, but the one subjected to the action. What in the active voice is the accusative, is now turned into a nominative, and the active's nominative vanishes. There remains no bound accusative in a passive voice, as that no longer makes sense.

> Example
>
> Active: =[eiobai leimedei]= means "You burned a forest";  
> Passive: =[**dhaeiobai** medei]= means "A forest **was burnt**".

The person, object, or thing subjecting our subject to this can be specified with a bound causative.

> Example
> 
> =[dhaeiobai medei **aoaqàjhiòqa** ioenhàsha]= means "A forest was burnt **by priests** because of delusions". It has two causatives `priest` and `delusions` in a row. As mentioned above, the first is the bound argument of the passive voice, while the latter is a regular unbound causative.

## The dative: reciprocal voice 
In this voice, the accusative vanishes and implicitly becomes the same as the nominative. It says that someone does something to themselves. There are no further bound accusatives; you cannot make a list including e.g. yourself like this. The focus really is on someone/something doing something to themselves, and nothing more.

> Example
>
> Active: =[eiobai leimedei]= means "You burned a forest";  
> Reciprocal: =[**dhaòeiobai**]= means "You burned **yourself**".

## The genitive: optative voice.
In this voice, the speaker is expressing a desire, perhaps about themselves, perhaps about someone else. This comes down to "I hope + Active"; all cases behave as in the active voice. Note that the wish is always from a first-person perspective. You cannot state wishes of other people like this!

> Example
>
> Active: =[eiobai leimedei]= means "You burned a forest";  
> Optative: =[**iàeiobai** leimedei]= means "**I hope you burned** a forest".

The instrumental denotes that some tool was used to achieve some action. It may appear in bound or unbound form. The tool may be a physical tool, like a hammer, or more abstract tools, such as a mindset of determination or spite. Perhaps even a person. As long as the tool contributed to the action, it counts, and you use the instrumental.

> Example
> 
> =[oànò **zhaoaeioba**]=, meaning "I fought **using fire**", has `fire` in the instrumental case, as the fire was a tool that contributed to the action of fighting.

> Example 
>
> =[mòeni **zhaoasoelò**]=, means "You are playing music **with love**". It has `love` as instrument, as making good music without love is impossible for this artist.
> 
> Note that this can also be written in English as "You are lovingly playing music". However, while in English this means the same, in Saia the adverbial interpretation is much more subjective. With the adverb, it simply _seems_ like the artist is playing lovingly. But this is the speaker's point of view. With the instrumental, this is a statement that it is not subjective, but objective. For more information, see the section on [adverbs](/grammar/adverbs) much later on.

If multiple tools are relevant, multiple instrumentals can be chained. They are ordered from "most important to success" to "least important to success".

> Example
>
> =[mòeni **zhaoasoelò** **zhaoafoeia**]= means "You are playing music **with love and movement**". The fact that the artist is putting heart and soul into it is a much more significant contribution than the fact they are using their arms to play the instrument. As such, the words are ordered the same way: `love` first, `movement` after.

Like the accusative, the dative also only appears in bound form. It generally denotes the indirect object of verbs, though as noted by the accusative case, there may be exceptions depending on the verbs used.

The indirect object is, as the name states, an object, but less important than the one listed by the accusative. Often the sentence can be rewritten in a form with an additional `to` as indirect objects often receive something. For instance, in "I gave **him** food", what was given was `food`, but to whom it was given was `him`. The sentence can be rewritten to include `to` as "I gave food **to him**".

> Example
>
> In the sentence "The lady played **the priests** music", `the priests` are the indirect object, and as such, require the dative. Turning this into Saia, we get =[mòenòroa rei **dhaiqàjhiòqa**]=. Here, Soul class =[qàjhiòqa]= has the plural dative prefix =[-dhai-]=.

If there are multiple direct objects, you can simply list them by writing them next to each other. No conjunctions are necessary (though they are allowed). The order in which they are listed can be mostly arbitrary, except that people of higher social standing have to be mentioned first.

> Example
>
> Expanding the previous example to also include the King in the audience, we get =[mòenòroa rei **dharoàn** **dhaiqàjhiòqa**]=.

The built-in dictionary lists words which accept an indirect object. (And all other bound arguments.)

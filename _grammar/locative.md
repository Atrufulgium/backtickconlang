The locative, whether bound or unbound, denotes a location or time something happens at. Think of English words like "at", "in", "on", "beside", "after", "during", etc.

> Example
> 
> =[zàqioòri eioba **seimedei**]=, means "A fire started **in the forest**", where `forest` is a Spirit Singular Locative because of the =[-sei-]=- prefix. Without any further information, "around the forest", "above the forest", and "near the forest" may also be valid, but generally the spatial locative will be as close to the word as possible. For a forest, the closest you can be is, of course, inside.

> Example
> 
> =[maloaòroa **zhasabhei**]=, means "He/She descended **from the sky**". Here, `sky` is bound by the verb `descend`, which gives the locative its "from" meaning and not something else.

The locative can also be chained to create more detailed explanations of where and/or when something happened. In this case, the order is from least specific to most specific. Spatial and temporal specifiers can be mixed.

> Example
> 
> A fragment =[**seimedei** **zhadhaa**]= has both `forest` and `rose` in locative form, in that order. This translates to "**in the forest, near the roses**". You can't go into roses (in any sane contexts); the closest you can get is simply "near" or "next to".

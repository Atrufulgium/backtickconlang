The genitive generally appears unbound, and indicates that a (bound or unbound) noun is possessed by the genitive noun. The word in genitive appears after the word it modifies, and the prefix can be literally translated as "of".

> Example
>
> If you want to talk about "the lady **of the forest**", you write it as =[rei **eimedei**]=. This assumes the lady is the subject, but =[rei]= can be further conjugated to fit into a larger sentence. For instance, consider =[oànòri dhaòlòqe dharei **eimedei**]= "The gardener fought **the forest's** lady".

The genitive can also be chained, just like in English.

> Example
>
> =[dhaa **odhaòlòqe** **iàroàn** **iàsaroà**]= means "the rose **of the gardener of the King of Saroah**". Or the slightly more readable alternative, "**Saroah's King's gardener's** rose".

If you want multiple owners, just like the nominative and accusative conjunctions need to be used.
